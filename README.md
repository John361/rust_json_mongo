# Json to mongo in Rust
This project is intended to put Rust into practice.

It is a hard language but with powerful features.

I will try to improve it as I get more knowledge.

The global idea is:
- Read a file containing a list of user as json
- Parse it into a list of user object
- Connect to mongodb and insert all
- Read all from mongodb and get a list
- Insert all in file as json

Principal keys should be:
- I/O manipulation
- Serialization/Deserialization
- Generic
- Database manipulation
- Error management
